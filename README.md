# Final_Year_Project
TM Boorman Final Year Project (Skripsie)

This repository contains the code for a final year dissertation paper that investigated savings one could make in using interventions such as solar panel installation and changing lights to LED. It was done using the LaunchLab (a small business in Stellenbosch, South Africa) as a test case.

Main contributions of the project where:
 - Software models of hot-water-cylinders/water-heaters/geysers based on a mathematical model (single-node).
 - Software model of Stellenbosch tariffs (monthly) for electricity used throughout the year of a small business.
 - Simulation of cost to a company using CSV data for up to a whole year with configuration options to allow comparison with solar power usage and with LED light replacement (this was done externally using a Jupyter Notebook).

 - This project made use of an external library to get solar radiation levels used in solar power calculations.
